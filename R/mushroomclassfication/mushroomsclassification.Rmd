loading the dataset
```{r}
mushroombase = read.csv(file = "mushrooms.csv" )

```

Basic Info About the dataset
```{r}
names(mushroombase)
```
```{r}
dim(mushroombase)
```

The Dataset has 23 Features and 8124 Instance 

```{r}

sum(is.na(mushroombase))
```


```{r}
sum(is.null(mushroombase))


```
There is  no NA and null  in Dataset, so we dont have missing values

```{r}
summary(mushroombase)
```

From the above it is clear that all the type class. so we need to factorize the dataset to use it.
Here the the target is Class.

so we have to train models in Classification and Clustering.


Factorize the Dataset
```{r}
for ( n in names(mushroombase)){
  
  mushroombase[n] = as.factor(unlist(mushroombase[n]))
}
str(mushroombase)
```

Spliting the Training and Test data in  2:1 (Train:Test)


```{r}
set.seed(134)
jumble = runif(nrow(mushroombase))
mushroombase = mushroombase[ordered(jumble),]
sampleindex = sample(2,nrow(mushroombase), replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.67, 0.33))
mushroomtrain = mushroombase[sampleindex == 1,]
mushroomtest = mushroombase[sampleindex == 2,]

```

```{r}
table(mushroomtrain$class)
```

From the above we can see the Edible class is postive class
```{r}
print(2795 / (2795 + 2591))
```
baseline is considering the positive class as prediticed for all instance which is 52% percent approximately.


```{r}
library(mlr)
mushroomTrain = makeClassifTask(data = mushroomtrain, target = "class")
mushroomTest = makeClassifTask(data = mushroomtest, target = "class")

```


```{r}
library(mlr)
mustree = makeLearner("classif.rpart", predict.type = "response")
treecv =  makeResampleDesc("CV",iters = 10L)
param = makeParamSet(
makeIntegerParam("minsplit",lower = 10, upper = 20),
makeIntegerParam("minbucket", lower = 5, upper = 10),
makeNumericParam("cp", lower = 0.001, upper = 0.1)
)

control = makeTuneControlGrid()

treetune <- tuneParams(learner = mustree, resampling = treecv, task = traintask, par.set = param, control = control, measures = acc)
```



```{r}

treetune$y

```



```{r}
treetune$x
tree = setHyperPars(mustree, par.vals = treetune$x)
traintree = train(tree, mushroomTrain)
predicttree = predict(traintree, mushroomTest)
table(mushroomtest$class,predicttree$data$response)
```


```{r}
library(rattle)	
fancyRpartPlot(traintree$learner.model)
```


```{r}
mushroomtest %>% ggplot(aes(x = odor,y = spore.print.color,color= predicttree$data$response)) + geom_point() 
```

```{r}
mushroomtest %>% ggplot(aes(x = odor,y = spore.print.color,color= class)) + geom_point() 
```

From the above the Decression Tree generationg result close to 100 which look like a over fit. we can club some more entires from orginal set and try to test the model


```{r}
nsample = sample(2,nrow(mushroombase),replace = TRUE)

test1mushroom = mushroombase[nsample == 1,]
test2mushroom = mushroombase[nsample == 2,]
mushroomTest1 = makeClassifTask(data= test1mushroom,target = "class")
mushroomTest2 = makeClassifTask(data= test2mushroom,target = "class")
```



```{r}
traintree1 = train(tree, mushroomTrain)
predicttree1 = predict(traintree1, mushroomTest1)
table(test1mushroom$class,predicttree1$data$response)
```



```{r}
traintree2 = train(tree, mushroomTrain)
predicttree2 = predict(traintree2, mushroomTest2)
table(test2mushroom$class,predicttree2$data$response)
```

From the Above the given dataset works well for the Decision Tree classification as for all the three test it is producing more than 98% so we can use this model .

```{r}
library(pROC)
library(ROCR)
library(gplots)
destreepredition = prediction(test2mushroom$class,predicttree2$data$response)
```
